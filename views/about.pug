          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I'm an in-development web developer. I'm a self-motivated individual with a love for all things technical--from programming (obviously), to math, physics, and formal logic. And while I'm relatively new to web development, I don't foresee myself going anywhere anytime soon: it's just too much fun.
          p Before transitioning into the world of tech, I was an adjunct professor and lecturer at several universities, most notably University of Southern California, University of California at Riverside, and Pepperdine University. Initially, coding was more of a hobby of mine, primarily used for writing technical papers and designing websites. But as of six months ago, I decided to take the plunge and invest the majority of my time and effort into becoming a programmer, the results of which you can see on this page.
